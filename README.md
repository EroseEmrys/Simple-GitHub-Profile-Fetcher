# Simple GitHub Profile Fetcher

This is a simple web application that allows you to fetch GitHub user profiles and their repositories. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The application consists of a single HTML page with input fields to enter a GitHub username. Upon entering a username and clicking the "Fetch Profile" button, the application fetches the user's profile information including their username, name, bio, and avatar. Additionally, it fetches the user's repositories, displaying their names, descriptions, and README files.
